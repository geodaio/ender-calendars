<h2>How It Began</h2>
<p>As current students, we strongly believe that the most crucial skill to have to be a successful student is to stay organized. 
  Keeping an up-to-date calendar is essential for students to stay on track and keep up with constant upcoming deadlines.Â 
Setting regular reminders on your phone sometimes is not enough. Having a calendar that fits different needs and is customizable 
  to the person is something many students could benefit from.

<h2>What is Ender?</h2>
<p>Ender is the calendar that is designed <i>For Students, By Students</i>. 
  With a focus on convenient, efficient, and organized calendars,
  Ender is an easy-to-use tool for students to keep track of their assignments, due dates, work, and personal events. Ender 
  strives to help reduce the amount of stress that comes with being a student by creating a platform 
  that allows users to have all their needs in one place.

<h2>Who Are We?</h2>
<p>We are Group 5 Studios, a team of university students based in New York, 
  with a goal of making quality software that isn't locked behind a paywall. </p>
